# Sample Docker and Python REST API
## Overview
As part of our multi-part series on Docker containerization, InCycle Software has assembled a sample Python REST API that illustrates using multi-stage Docker builds. One of the most challenging things about building Docker images is keeping the image size to a minimum. With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. This allows you to selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you donâ€™t want in the final image. 

In this sample three stages are used to produce the final Docker image
1. Base - which sets up initial base configuration required by subsequent stages.
2. Build - this stage uses a Python Docker Hub image to provide necessary dependencies to build the API and produce the final solution.
3. Publish - This stage copies the built python script created by the build. A minimally provsioned alpine image as the base for the production image.

## Prerequisites
Docker Desktop for Mac/Windows. 
You can verify Docker is running by executing  ```docker --version ``` from the command prompt.

## Walkthrough
1. Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build . -t weather-api:v1
-or-
docker build . -t weather-forecast-api:v1 --target=publish
to target a specific stage
```
2. Run the image and create the container
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 weather-api:v1
```
3. Access the container to confirm it is working. 
```
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/resources/weather
```
